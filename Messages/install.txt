Wordpress Gutenberg Blocks Autocomplete
=======================================

Thank you for downloading the Wordpress Gutenberg Blocks Autocompletion.
This is very much a work in progress as I try to figure out the best way to implement a few of them.
I am also assuming that you are using the default styling for each class that associates to a style.

This works under the HTML syntax.

You can see an updated list of all current usable blocks on the wiki page at: https://github.com/Skullmonkey/Wordpress-Gutenberg-Blocks-Autocomplete/wiki/Autocompletions-List
