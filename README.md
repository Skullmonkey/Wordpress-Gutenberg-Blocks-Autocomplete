# Wordpress-Gutenberg-Blocks-Autocomplete
Autocompletion for WordPress Gutenberg blocks.

# Why?
I use emmet A LOT when writing articles because it saves me a TON of time. I have been dreading switching to WordPress 5 because of the new editor. But sooner or later, I am going to have to switch. But instead of going back and forth making the blocks, copying them over, editing the blocks how I would like them, and then copying them back to WordPress, I can make an autocompletion list and take 2 steps out of the equasion.

# Work in progress
I have most of the common blocks set up already. As I figure out more of them and how they work, I will add them to this repo and push an update.

That being said, if you would like to help with this list, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request. I will be sure to give you credit for your contribution.
